          I&apos;ve always been curious about how things work. As a kid, I loved
          taking apart my phone, my PSP, even my watch, just to see what was
          inside and how to put it back together. With both my brother and
          sister working in tech, it was probably only a matter of time before I
          joined the world of development myself.

          During COVID-19 pandemic, I decided to explore web development, and
          quickly discovered how much I enjoy solving problems, building
          systems, and creating seamless digital experiences from scratch.

          Today, I&apos;m a{" "}

            Full Stack Developer (frontend oriented) with 5 years

          of experience building web applications end to end. I enjoy connecting
          all the dots - from UI to backendâ€”to create complete, well -
          structured solutions. I&apos;ve worked across FinTech and
          Cybersecurity industries, in both startup and corporate environments,
          and I&apos;m known for identifying edge cases early and thinking
          through complex systems with a user-centric mindset.

          What drives me most is the blend of creativity, problem-solving, and
          continuous learning that development offers.
